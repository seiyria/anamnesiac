      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - In combat ATK buff.
      
      - Good buffs for Invokers.
      
      - Talents make her self sufficient and doesn't require party synergy.
      
      - Fire Bolt is a homing attack.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Talents are greedy outside of a caster composition.
      
      - Hard locked into fire. Has no real secondary element.
      
      - Staff casting.
      

      **Rotation**

      *Normal > CA Explosion > Fire Bolt > Explosion > Explosion (General damage rotation. Recommended with 101 AP.)*
      
      *Normal > CA Fire Bolt > Explosion > Fire Bolt (Moving target rotation.)*

      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Non-ace so cheaper to MLB and augment.
      
      - Has good damage output, especially for a non-ace.
      
      - Can inflict curse.
      
      - Good party wide buffs and a grit talent to help him live.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Locked into dark.
      
      - Extremely squishy.
      
      - Melee normals and short ranged spells can make him awkward to play.
      
      - Non-ace so has less stats.
      

      **Rotation**

      *CA Shadow Needles > Reaping Spark > Shadow Needles > Spam till out of AP (Ranged damage rotation.)*
      
      *Normal > Shadow Needles > Reaping Spark > Cursed Devourer (Melee damage rotation.)*

    notes: >
      _Mavelle is here and brings a unique playstyle to the table. Unlike other invokers Mavelle is about being a true one skill
      wonder. She sets up her damage by using Aerial Lancer and Hail orb. After this she spends her time using her Arctic Impact and
      waiting for her AP to recharge until the buffs run out and repeat. It's not a play style for everyone but it's certainly not
      a bad one if you enjoy that kind of thing. She's a damage carry and does her job well, especially on Ice weak bosses where
      she'll really pack a punch. She also does at least bring party wide AP recovery which is a nice perk to give._
      
      _Her downsides are well, she's an invoker, she will always be elemental locked and she is essentially hard locked to ice due
      to her play style. Aurora rings may as well not even be a skill in her arsenal. Also Arctic Impact comes with two issues, it
      isn't good against moving targets and it sends stunned targets into the heavens. This can make her extremely frustrating to play
      alongside and to play as. But when she's hitting those big numbers, you'll quickly find her enjoyable._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Orb casting.
      
      - Unique play style.
      
      - Deals high damage, very good against ice weak enemies.
      
      - Ap recovery buff for the party.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Locked in on Ice.
      
      - Arctic Impact can send stunned enemies up high. It can also whiff against mobile foes.
      

      **Rotation**

      *Normal > CA Aerial Lancer > Hail Orb (Set up combo)*
      
      *Normal > CA Crystalized Acrtic Impact > Dash Cancel after first hit (Nuke rotation)*

      - High damage
      
      - Ap recovery buff on normal for the party.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Earth focused.
      
      - Staff cast times with small cast reduction.
      
      - Crush is a terrible spell for your filler earth spell.
      
      - Provides almost nothing to the party. What she does give has been beaten by 3 characters.

  notes: >
      _Though awakened Myuria still lacks party support, she doesn't need it; her own stats and skills were beefed up so much, even against enemies she does
      neutral damage to you'd be hard pressed to get more merit out of a party buffer.  Her rush gain similarly went from abysmal to excellent, making it quite
      feasible for her to keep her INT+80% up between rush cycles.  ATK-based characters have lately been catching up to her power, but the damage output
      her awakening introduced was so absurd at the time that every event since her release has featured off-element resistance._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Plasma Cyclone for great AoE
      
      - Good stun rate buff.
      
      - Talents make her self sufficient and doesn't require party synergy.
      
      - Deals good damage.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Talents are greedy.
      
      - High AP costs.
      
      - Staff casting.
      
      - Slow rush gain.
      

      **Rotation**

      *Normal > CA Plasma Cyclone > Thunder Flare > Plasma Cyclone*
      
      *Normal > Thunder Flare > Lightning Blast > Thunder Flare ^n - If casting from outside Plast Cyclone's Range*

  notes: >
      _Ronyx's awakening goes all-out on his party support, amping his already unsurpassed party INT by another +20%, making his selfish talents partywide, 
      slapping on substantial cast time reductions, INT>ATK conversion for the non-casters, and a beefy Damage+80% for everyone, giving him a kit that makes
      him a major boon to casters but provides welcome buffs to everyone in general.  His rush gain's also been improved, but unfortunately he's still loaded with
      slow, localized spells that require an immobile target, and with Heraldry being element-locked he's stuck in Fire-weak fights unless you only want him for his
      buffs._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong party wide INT buff.
      
      - Reduces cast times by 50% post rush.
      
      - Non-ace so cheaper to MLB and augment.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Slow cast times with expensive spells which can miss.
      
      - Abysmal AI.
      
      - Non-ace so has less stats.

  notes: >
      _Awakening's emphasized Lymle's bulk, fire damage, and rush buff; notably she now provides the party INT+20% and physical classes receive an impressive
      Fire Damage+60%.  Her rush buff's been increased to a whopping INT+120% and lasts five seconds longer.  Her own rush gain's also gone from horrid to
      above average.  She's still unfortunately cursed with slow and unreliable fire spells, and still lacks AP cost reduction to fit more 300% spells in, though assists
      and teambuilding can fix the latter._

      - Deals good damage post rush.
      
      - Talents give her some good survivability.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - No party wide talent or post rush buffs.
      
      - Mediocre damage pre-rush.
      
      - Staff casting.
      
      - Non-ace so has less stats.

  notes: >
      _Faize's awakening further enhances his party buffing both offensively and defensively; to oversimplify, he's effectively Capell-meets-Fiore with a side of party 
      Guts now.  Extinction meshes with his kit well, both providing obscene rush gain and offering a delayed hit he can exploit with his new skill chain talent, but
      you'll still be forced to bring Needles for combo filler without at least -10% AP.  His rush now has a proper mult as well.  Strong on his own, incredible with
      INT buffs; even without them though his party support is highly appreciated.  Note that alongside his awakening (but not tied to it), he was also reworked to
      be a Hrist-style sheath, giving him a proper ranged normal and facilitating full combos as a result.  While able to use sheathes, only his normals and rush
      can change elements.  It hurts his combo damage significantly to use him against anything that isn't dark weak, but his talents and a functional rush may
      be enough merit for him depending on your needs.
      
      If strictly interested in his party talents, he gains them all by Awk6, avoiding needing to spend any gammas and making for an accessible stunbot that
      surpasses Ratix/Capell in performance on both manual and auto.  Awk10 adds a lot of damage output if intending to play him seriously._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Non-ace so cheaper to MLB and augment.
      
      - Has good damage output, especially for a non-ace.
      
      - Can inflict curse.
      
      - Good party wide buffs and a grit talent to help him live.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Locked into dark.
      
      - Extremely squishy.
      
      - Melee normals and short ranged spells can make him awkward to play.
      
      - Non-ace so has less stats.

  notes: >
      _Standard light caster.  Awakening scooped her damage output out of the gutters, though it isn't anything mindblowing still.  Her rush gain is fixed, but her rush
      buff is still underwhelming.  Having access to Growth on top of her talents gives her the ability to buff both INT and ATK for the party._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Plasma Cyclone for great AoE
      
      - Party wide INT buff for caster comps
      
      - Can silence enemies.
      
      - Deals good damage.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Doesn't bring much aside from her INT buff.
      
      - High AP costs.
      
      - Staff casting.
      

      **Rotation**

      *Normal > CA Silencing Star Light > Filler > Silencing Star Light^n*
      
      *Fillers: Growth for buffing; Sunshine for damage; Plasma Cyclone for crowd control, rush gain, and reliability*
