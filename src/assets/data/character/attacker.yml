      _With the rerun of NieR, 2B goes from top tier to meta breaking. Again. She now has the out and out best ATK buff in the game and
      will probably be this way for a long time. Her personal damage is also quite good, especially now that Arms 2 is restored to
      how it was. Unnerfing her has basically meant anyone who got her in October or November is getting great value for money._
      
      _Downsides remain the same. Self-imbue is still both a pro and a con, but with OHS coverage it isn't much of a drawback. The 
      ATK buff is still inconsistent, but 40% is still as good as Fidel and better then anything H.Millie can do even with her 
      conditional. 2B, like all other NieR characters, s absolutely broken for GL and if you want to faceroll content just use 2B
      and co._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong ATK based buff and elemental post-rush buff.
      
      - Huge AP recovery on normal buff.
      
      - Cheaper dodging and can air dodge.
      
      - Innate Light & Dark imbue.
      
      - Has a melee and ranged skill set.
      
      
      **Cons**

      - ATK buff condition is inconsistent.
      
      - Self-imbue can be a downside against certain bosses if you don't own certain weapons.

      _Fidel, the starter character and sometimes face of the app icon. Fidel has suffered as time has gone on. He has the highest
      unconditional party-wide buff in the game at 40%, though both Lasswell and 2B can surpass it with the right conditions and
      party composition. His AP reduction talent and really potent AP reduection post rush, lets him really output a lot of damage
      by chaining attacks._
      
      
      _For downsides, well, all he is bringing to the party is an ATK buff, characters like 2B and Halloween Millie bring similar or
      suprior levels of buffing with AP recovery on top. Even the freebie Ace of the FFBE collab Lasswell brings a slight bonus
      to melee characters in movement field nullification. His damage is also not stellar, he has quite a low attack stat compared
      to other attacks and his party wide buff and ability to spam attacks more don't make up for it compared to other attackers._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong ATK based buff for the party.
      
      - AP reduction and even more post-rush allows skill spamming.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Doesn't bring any utility beyond his ATK buff.
      
      - Low ATK stat gives him lower damage compared to competing units.

      _Fidel, the starter character and sometimes face of the app icon. He has the highest unconditional party-wide buff in the game 
      at 50% now due to awakening. His AP reduction talent and really potent AP reduection post-rush, lets him really output a lot of 
      damage by chaining attacks. Due to this, he can spam his improved Air Raid (720%!!) for tons of damage and rush gain. He will 
      be a solid pick even if there are better units out._
      
      
      _Despite awakening increasing his own damage output, it doesn't change his role as being only an ATK buffer. The 50% ATK is nice
      but with Valentine Rena and buff to 2B, he can be outshined due to those units having better party utility despite said units
      having conditionals._

      - Can be used also be played at range with Air Slash > Empyrean Slash spam
      
      - Air Raid has high rush gain. This makes <20 second rushes very possible after an initial rush
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Doesn't bring any utility beyond his ATK buff
      
      - All his awakening talents only affect himself

      _Cliff comes in as the first attacker carry ace. A fun knuckles wielding character who has a lot of strong selfish buffs that
      help him dish out plenty of damage. He's good for solo content, or when the party is built for getting the best out of him.
      His combination of ATK buff, crit rate buff and AP reduction buff gives him a faster paced playstyle then many other
      characters in the game. His rush also packs one hell of a punch as well, with a massive multiplier on it to make up for the
      lack of post rush buff._
      
      
      _For downsides his greed is his undoing, if the party isn't playing to strengths he isn't as effective. He lacks any kind of 
      ranged option, so playing it safe or keeping up some form of damage during certain attacks isn't really an option. Also not
      having a post rush buff kind of sucks and means his damage really has to make up for it._

      _Anne is a character who fills a niche and that's about it. She's very good against the crystal Guardian, other than that
      nearly every other 5 star character in the game is better than her. She is a crit fiend and provides the best crit buff in
      the game a post rush 60%, plus a 30% crit rate for the party passively is nothing to ignore. But that's about all she has
      going for her. Her damage is bad, she gives no other utility, she has no ranged option, and being a non-ace means she has
      less stats so is just generally squishier. If you need a character to do Crystal Guardian she's a great pick, otherwise
      ignore her._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Gives a strong passive crit rate and an unmatched post-rush buff to crit rate
      
      - 5 star non-ace so costs less to limit break and augment
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats
      
      - Poor damage and little utility beyond crit buffing

  notes: >
      _Papa Camuze enters the game in order to show his son how it's done. By being kind of bad as well. Daril, like his son, brings
      a powerful party wide utility in the form of -20% to AP cost. This grows to an even more potent -40% as a post rush buff. His
      anti-humanoid talent does give him above average damage against humanoids but it's lacklustre otherwise. His AP reduction
      does allow for 20 second rush cycles and helps characters such as healers who don't have reduction with their high cost
      AP skills/spells._
      
      
      _His downsides are numerous, being a 5 star he has less stats then an ace. His AP reduction is powerful but it's all he brings
      to the table. His damage is also poor if not up against a humanoid. Plus for characters who already have large AP cost reduction
      talents he isn't doing anything for them except post rush and that just isn't good enough. In summary Daril fills a nice niche
      to play around with in a pre-made party but he isn't very good beyond that._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Powerful AP reduction party-wide buff
      
      - Good damage against humanoids
      
      - 5 star non-ace so costs less to limit break and augment
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats
      
      - Doesn't bring any utility beyond his AP reduction
      
      - Bad damage against non-humanoids

      _Roddick comes to the game to take his place as the king of cheese strats in content with his incredible 40% buff to stun chance.
      He also provides any casters with a slight cast time buff. As well as buffing his own attack. On top of that his post rush buff
      while selfish is very powerful for him. Though the main reason to run him, is for the much easier stuns that can just lock
      enemies in place for an entire fight._
      
      
      _He does have downsides, he isn't providing any stellar party wide buffs but his stun rate. He struggles with compositions who
      don't really benefit from bolstering rushes or with characters who aren't running an element imbue. He also doesn't pack
      as much punch as some of the other attackers you can bring. However if you're struggling to get a clear, try finding a good
      Roddick player and see if the extra elemental bursts make an improvement to your runs._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Slight invoking time buff
      
      - Ridiculous buff to partywide stun rate
      
      - Strong greedy post-rush buff
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Brings little utility beyond his stun buff
      
      - Needs some slight build around to take advantage of his buff

      _Summer Reimi enters the game to make guys drool over her shorts and to be a solid attack buffer. With the shackles taken off
      Summer Reimi is now much more competitive providing a 45/55 conditional ATK buff, 100% AP recovery on normals for short ranged
      attackers. She still buffs rush combo damage which still remains a rare buff on GL and links well with her new juiced up rush.
      Plus she gives 40% Single Target damage to the party post rush and a nice nullification of status ailments which can be useful
      in certain fights. Overall, while she may not be as good a buffer as 2b, she is certainly close to that level and a welcome
      addition._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong ATK buffs.

      - Rush combo damage buff.
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Slow rush gain.
      
      - Awkward attack buff.
      
      - Subpar moveset.

      _Lenneth entered the game as a kind of worse Summer Reimi, and has fallen off the mark pretty fast. Her attack buff applies to
      the party and is unconditional, but at this point it's been matched by Lasswell. Her rush combo damage buff is still on the 
      rare side and hers is better than Summer Reimi's. Silencing on attacks is, okay, useful if it goes off but there are no
      guarantees. Her post rush debuff is quite strong and pretty unique as well which is probaby her strongest tool left in her kit._
      
      
      _However all of this doesn't really mean you want to run her. No AP recovery like most of the high tier attack buffers bring
      her attack buff is even beaten by Fidel, never mind the likes oh Halloween Millie and 2B. Her rush debuff is nice as is her
      rush combo damage buff but it's not enough to really make the unit more viable then several other options in both the limited 
      and permanent ace attacker pool._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Unconditional good ATK buff
      
      - Rush combo damage buff
      
      - Defence debuff on rush for enemies.
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - ATK buff has been exceeded by many attackers making it redundant in a lot of comps
      
      - Silence has a low chance to apply making it a poor talent that doesn't do much
      
      - Doesn't do enough other attackers don't already do better

      _Claude is a very specific attack buffer, he gives a massive attack boost to Attackers and Defenders, he also provides 
      some survability to healers on top which is a nice perk. He's a character which is quite good when the meta is dominated by
      defenders and attackers. But bad if we have any sharpshooters or invokers who see their way into frequent play. He also
      provides everyone AP recovery on normals. Claude's buffs mean he is definetly a character suited to a certain comp. His post
      rush buff is reasonably strong, especially if you're trying to avoid shooters as the most prominent damage buffs come from Maria
      and 9S._
      
      
      _The negatives I've already touched on, he's not offering much but AP recovery to shooters and Invokers meaning that he's kind
      of redundant with them on his team, especially with the likes of Maria or 9S who make his post rush buff redundant as well.
      Though over all if you build a team with Claude in mind they'll be able to dish out some serious damage._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Powerful ATK buff for attackers and defenders.
      
      - Damage reduction for healers.
      
      - Ap recovery on Normals.
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Poor synergy with sharpshooters and invokers.
      
      - Post-rush buff made redundant by commonly seen characters like Maria and 9S.

      _A 5 star non-ace who is similar to Cliff in design. Phia has the advantage of being ranged, which means she can play things
      a little safer then Cliff. Phia is a critical hit fiend. Boasting a huge critical hit rate and damage buff of 50% for herself.
      She also increases her own ATK while decreasing her own DEF by 20% making her quite the glass cannon. She's great for Crystal
      Guardian for a start, but an experienced player can use her effectively as a damage carry in a wide variety of content._
      
      
      _Aside from the lesser stats of not being an Ace Phia has her fair share of issues. Just like Cliff she provides no utility to
      the party beyond the occasional freezing of an enemy. Also her low defence coupled with the general lower stats of a non-ace
      mean she isn't recommended for new players or taking on new content as she is extremly squishy and is best used when you know
      how to get the best out of her and not tank the floor._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - High damage output.
      
      - 5 star non-ace so costs less to limit break and augment.
      
      - Can freeze enemies.
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats.
      
      - Provides nothing to the rest of the party.
      
      - Glass cannon so not new player or new content friendly.

  notes: >
      _Albel enters the game as an interesting character, he treads the line between buffer and attack, doing neither very well. His
      ATK buff works similar to Claude and at this point there are quite a few characters who match or surpass his single target
      damage buff. His debuff isn't really that strong, or at least not enough to consider him over other characters, though it
      does mean he makes Lenneth even worse. His post rush buff is interesting, halving his defence in exchange for doubling his
      attack makes him a super glass cannon, any type of meaningful AP reduction while this is active will make him a powerhouse.
      However his pre-rush damage is a bit underwhelming by comparison._
      
      
      _His downsides we've touched upon, he's not a bad character by any means, but he's not really exceptional at either being a 
      buffer, where he gets beaten out, and he has to wait till post rush to truly become a damage carry. Plus the downside of his
      rush buff makes him very squishy so newer players may find him a bit challenging to use as they grasp game and boss fight 
      mechanics._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Decent variety of buffs
      
      - High post rush damage
      
      - Rare debuffing of enemy talent
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Super squishy post rush
      
      - Buffs are easily made redundant
      
      - Not the best skill options

  notes: >
      _Ilia enters the game in order to tilt you when you pull her on a limited banner. She's quite a late arrival for a 5 star and is
      a weak one on top. However she does have some unique things going for her on the buff front. Damage to multiple enemies is not
      a commonly seen buff, mostly because it's not very useful in a boss fight, but for MoT and bosses with trash waves and adds 
      it could have some relevance. Boosting fire damage dealt for the party is an odd one but if the party can exploit it on a fire
      weak boss, it's a pretty nice buff to have. Her ATK buff isn't amazing at this point in GL a lot of characters beat it or match
      it and have other more relevant buffs._
      
      
      _Her draw backs are, as mentioned, her ATk buff just isn't that good by todays standards. Also her ATK buff and fire damage buff
      don't have the best synergy since the fire damage is more relevant for fire invokers. Plus being a 5 star means she has less
      stats and overall just poor damage for an attacker. She's not bad by any means but at this point in GL you can do much better._
      
      
      **TL DR**

      - Unique party wide buffs
      
      - Built in AP reduction
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats.
      
      - Buffs aren't really that relevant outside of niche comps and content
      
      - ATK buff is overshadowed by many other attackers

      _Global's first true quality damage carry comes in the form of best girl Clair. Dressed in a rather revealing outfit to boot.
      Halloween Clair brings a lot of damage to your party, in fact past 100 hit count she has the highest DPS in the game. She has
      hit count related buffs, one boosting her own ATK and another boosting party wide ATK damage. Her built in AP reduction allows
      her to get out more attack. Plus her ATK buff to herself means her attack is the second highest in the game after Winter Fidel.
      She also does bring a little utility, aside from her ATK damage buff her post rush buff increases party DEF by 30% while 
      lowering it by the same amount for enemies._
      
      
      _Clair still has her issues however, her rush gain could be better for a start. Also she's quite squishy as well so does require
      some level of skill to use effectively. Though really in GL she's pretty hard to say no to as a damage carry in the hands of a
      good player._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Extremely high damage output
      
      - Reasonably rare post rush buff and debuff

      **Cons**

      _Global gets its first Arms user and boy is it a cute one. Halloween Millie is a pretty strong buff character who was wronged 
      by the introduction of 2b before her. However she's still a very strong buffer in her own right, even if overshadowed by 2B.
      She gives both a solid attack buff and AP recovery on normals. She also has the niche ability to nullify the annoying movement
      and rush gauge reduction fields, and unlike others who have this buff her isn't restricted, it's for the whole party. Her
      talent with pumpkin smash means it makes for a powerful finisher to an attack chain. She also has both a solid range or melee
      set up and being an Arms user means she actually has good normals at both long and short range. Her post rush buff also boosts
      party elemental damage by 50%._
      
      
      _She still has downsides, certain characters can surpass her ATK buff, especially with certain compositions. Arms normals have
      a bit of an awkward range which means trying to normal may make you run into stuff while you get used to it. Also her rush
      gain is a bit on the slow side and her AI gets very confused as to whether it wants to go range or melee._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good party wide buffs
      
      - Niche buff to deal with movement and rush reduction fields
      
      - Very flexible with range. Can do melee or ranged combat.
      
      - Awooo
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Ranged normals can be awkward to use at first
      
      - Rush gain could be better

      _Fayt arrived at a bad time for an attack buffer, overshadowed by 2B and to a lesser extent Halloween Millie, he never really
      got his chance to shine like he should have. However that doesn't mean he's not aa good character. Especially since the other
      two were limited characters while Fayt will always be available. Fayt comes with a decent attack buff that has been exceeded
      in recent characters but may still be useful. His passive elemental buff isn't too common and his post rush upgrade of it
      matches that of 2B and Halloween Millie. On top of that Fayt has a build in double imbue of light and fire, the fire imbue
      being very nice as it isn't an element covered by ohs right now._
      
      
      _Fayt still has downsides, aside from just being a downgrade from two limited characters. His lack of ranged filler hurts him
      as it means his options are limited at times. Talented imbues can always be a double edge sword when bosses with resists come
      into play and you don't have the weakness weapon to cancel out the imbue. Also his anti-flinch is pretty redundant at this
      point with so many strong defenders._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Decent ATK buff
      
      - Double self imbue
      
      - Passive elemental damage buff
      
      - Awooo
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Has no ranged attack
      
      - Needs certain weapons against bosses with elemental resist
      
      - His anti-flinch is pretty useless at this point

  notes: >
      _Michael is a very unique character who at least wins kudos for having a unique design compared to other characters. He is
      meant to be a damage carry, but to truly fill that role he needs to first die in order to get his 25% stat buff. He does bring
      a good attack buff for attackers, but it's not stellar. He buffs his own fire damage for all his skills as well. His strongest
      point is probably his post rush buff, a massive AP cost reduction for himself to dish out damage. Worth noting his stat buff
      for each dead ally counts even after revives, whether that be reviving with gems. (Please don't.) Or giving him synergy with
      Evelysse._
      
      
      _Michael's downsides are many. He isn't much of a damage carry if people aren't dying for him, really adding extra emphasis to
      the term carry. His attack buff is surpassed by plenty of attackers at this point and his selfish talents aren't really that
      good. His attacks can also be a bit clunky to use and if there is any boss with fire resist you'd best have some knuckles with
      an imbue they're weak or neutral too._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Unique design
      
      - Decent ATK buff for attackers
      
      - Deals decent damage
      
      - Really good against fire weak bosses
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Has no ranged attack
      
      - Needs people to die to be effective
      
      - Needs elemental imbue knuckles if enemy resists fire

      _For Christmas Fidel decides to have a go at being GLs first dual gun user. He comes as a damage carry, boasting a high amount
      of attack power and the 2nd highest dps in the game. He does provide some utility to the party, a weak ATK buff if you don't
      have one. AP recovery but only after 100 hits and an ATK damage buff but only after 200 hits. He self buffs his ATK and HIT
      before even getting into combat and with his talent focusing on bombing run it's not surprising his damage revolves around 
      spamming it with max cancel bonus, along with bullet barrage. His post rush buff reduces his AP costs to let him spam even more
      plus he gets a nice crit bonus if one isn't already being given to boost his damage output a little._
      
      
      _Winter Fidel does have some downsides. Bombing run makes you leap back which can make it awkward to use as much as you want to
      increasing the clunk factor of the skill. Also his more powerful party buffs are behind hit counts and while 100 hits isn't
      that difficult 200 can become a bit of a task, though reaching it before rushing will provide a good damage boost._

      _Tearful Welch. Welch finally gets made into a 5 star, a freebie non-ace as well. Her best role is as a griefer of the party
      lowering everyones DEF by 50% but also all enemies as well. Her post rush buff increases party ATK by 50% and nullifies your
      DEF with a -100% debuff so everything hits you like it was a critical hit. Tearful Welch is only good if you're seeing to add
      some challenge to a party or do some griefing. Please kick them if they enter your rooms and leave if one joins._

  notes: >
      _Meracle enters as another damage carry similar to Cliff. Her buffs are generally selfish but unlike Cliff she does bring at
      least something to the party if characters are at short range and AP recovery to defenders, these two talents mean she's a
      good friend to defenders and in the current FFBE collab meta, that suits her very well. She gets stronger as hit count
      increases as well but that ATK buff may well already be in effect from an ATK buffer such as 2B or Lasswell. Her damage is
      obviously very good and her crit rate buff for short range means she's usable for Crystal Guardian._
      
      
      _Her downside is simply that she doesn't really pack enough punch to justify her poor utility for the party. However if you have
      a defender in the mix and no AP recovery for them then Meracle justifies her place in a team at that point._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Does a good amount of damage
      
      - Some weak utility to the party
      
      - Works well with hit counter characters if no ATK buffer
      
            
      **Cons**
            
      - Party Utility is weak without the right characters
      
      - If no ATK buffer it requires a high hit count to get the most out of her

      _As free units go, Lasswell is surprisingly higher quality than previous offerings. He is essentially a poverty Claude, offering
      ATK+45% to close range allies and 30% baseline. Alongside his decent dps, he is competitive with 2B in proper comps, and he 
      nullifies Slow Fields too. On top of all of this he's also had 3 of his 4 skills buffed from JP, Tranquility and Mirror of
      Haze both have their ATK multiplier increased from 200 to 250. His main damage dealing skill also recieves a slight buff,
      increasing its multiplier from 400 to 450. This means he'll pack a bit more punch than originally expected._
      
      
      _His rush buff might as well not exist, as it is easily overwritten by the likes of Maria and 9S, and he has no AP on-hit, 
      like 2B does. but you can't ask for everything, can you? You and your fantasies can never be quenched, can they?!_
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong unconditional ATK buff, that gets even better for melee characters.
      
      - Nullifies annoying movement fields for melee.
      
      - Free MLB Ace
      
      - Innate Ice Imbue attacks
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Does little for ranged characters
      
      - Gives no AP recovery unlike other buffers

      _Verda's valentine gift to the players is showing up before her permanent version is out. Valentine Verda joins Winter Fidel
      and Halloween Clair as a powerful attack carry. She does her job pretty well, even providing some pretty good utility, her
      close range attacks debuff enemies making them take more ATK and INT damage. She also provides AP reduction past a skill
      chain of 3 for the whole party, though some characters will struggle to use this effectively. Her talent that boosts her
      ATK damage significantly based upon her own skill chain is very powerful and doable with her low AP cost skills, bost 5
      skill chain she'll be hitting extremely hard, especially with her debuff active. Post rush Verda helps make the parties
      damage much better and her own even more insane with an even more potent version of her unique ATK and INT damage taken
      debuffs._
      
      
      _As for downsides it's important to say is that Verda's animations are pretty slow, which also makes her rush gain kind of
      questionable as well. Also her AP reduction party buff isn't that amazing for certain characters so it's not much of a perk.
      However she is meant to be a carry so as long as she's hitting hard she's doing what you wanted._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Brings a lot of damage
      
      - Some weak utility to the party
      
      - Unique debuffs to enemies
      
            
      **Cons**
            
      - Slow attacking animations
      
      - Slow Rush gain

      _Rena gets a cat girl alt so she can drain the wallets of all her fan boys. Oh and she's a really good attack buffer on top of
      that. Rena brings a super meaty ATK buff of 40% for the party and 60% for all melee users. On top of that she gives unique buffs
      to attackers such as a larger than usual anti-flinch effect while using Charge Assault, and nullifying charge assaults critical
      hit penalty. Plus she gives attackers AP recovery. It helps she has some surivability as well with a pretty good grit talent. 
      Her post rush buff is also powerful, giving a high single target buff that isn't easily matched._
      
      
      _Of course there are downsides to Rena. The first being her party buffs being so limited, the lack of AP recovery means you
      lack such an important attack buffer buff for the rest of the party. She's far more of a build around character than 2b or
      Halloween Millie are because of this, you probably want a attacker carry and another attack buffer for the AP buff to make
      her truly godlike, but just bringing one of those two will make a big difference as well. However it is undeniable that in
      a proper composition VRena is the best attack buffer, but due to her limitations it's hard to recommend her over the likes
      of 2B for pubbing._

  notes: >
      _Mirage joins the roster as another permanent character and attacker carry. She has a very similar move set to Cliff with only
      her signature move being the change, though that is enough to have a different rotation. Mirage brings some party buffs to the
      table, a weak ATK buff that will be passable if she doesn't have an attack carry. Her other two buffs are quite strong but
      require a composition which focuses on being at close range. ATK damage buffs are still at a premium and AP recovery on normals
      is always very nice, especially at such a high percent. Her greedy talent that buffs her crit rate and damage requires her to
      have 100% HP which can be inconsistent, so an accessory or weapon with sustain is advised to get the most out of her. Post rush
      Mirage can deal more damage with an AP reduction and her regen helps keep her HP topped up to pair up well with her crit talent.
      
      As for her weaknesses, Mirage suffers from the lack of a ranged option like other knuckle users which reduces the ability to
      play it safe at times and bosses who like to go airborne or run around a lot can cause issues. Her buffs while good are quite
      conditional so she requires the right composition to shine. On top of that HP buffs are quite inconsistent and are very player
      skill reliant so aren't the best even if powerful._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Varied buffs that are quite strong.
      
      - Deals high damage.
      
      - Has post rush regen for sustain.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Buff conditions require being built around or are inconsistent.
      
      - Lack of a ranged attack can cause issues with cetain bosses.

  notes: >
      _Best boy Ashton arrives as the first permanent dual sword user for GL. He is a mixture of carry and buffer, providing a good
      pre-rush elemental damage buff and a still rare rush damage buff based on hit count. His play style is fast paced and revolves
      around making use of ice and fire skills to keep up buffs that help increase damage output. His ice skills provide him a ranged
      combo while his fire skills a melee combo, you can switch load out depending on fight so you can make up if you lack an ice or
      fire imbue weapon._
      
      _As for downsides, being a mix of buffer and carry he excels at neither, but that isn't a major downside. The bigger issues are
      his elemental damage buff gets overwritten by quite a few characters post rush buff, including the extremely popular 2b. Also the
      rush buff needs high hit counts to get the most out of it. However Ashton is a good, fun, fast paced all rounder._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong Elemental and Rush damage buff.
      
      - Deals good damage.
      
      - Has both a ranged and melee combo.
      
      - Fun playstyle.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Elemental damage buff gets overwritten by a lot of characters post rush. Some of which are extremely popular.
      
      - Rush damage buff requires high hit count to get the best from it.

      _Rena arrives as a bride and to show that this banner should have come some time a go. Her buffs feel quite dated though some
      are actually not bad. While her ATK buff is very bad, her single target is even worse and to top it off that's barely a post
      rush buff with a defender in your party. However the saving grace is the regeneration buff she gives, it's very potent
      especially when you meet 100 hit count which isn't too tall a task, it's not unreasonable to consider her for a comp which
      wants lots of attackers. (Such as building around VRena or Awakened Dias) For a form of sustain. She has a self AP cost 
      reduction and ATK buff at 50 hits and her rush multiplier is 4500 so she'll do a decent amount of damage overall. However
      she's a bit of an oddball buffer but isn't unusable._

      **Cons**
      
      - Awful ATK and Single Target damage buff.
      
      - What kind of post rush buff is that?

  notes: >            
      **TL DR**
      
      _Precis takes off the santa costume to join us as our latest attacker permanent ace and the permanent arms user. Precis is a bit
      of a lack luster character but isn't terrible. She has a self ATK buff that is conditional but makes up for her lack of attack
      stat. She has a decent conditional crit chance talent and she can output some good damage by skill chaining. Plus her hc 
      extension helps hit count compositions never actually lose hit count except after rushing, which ties in with her attack buff.
      She also provides health regeneration totalling 60% of each characters max HP over 20 seconds. Plus her rush multiplier is
      pretty damn juicy at 4.5k meaning that getting to 100 hits and rushing should yield a good rush._
      
      _Precis biggest problem is her lack of attack when her talents point towards a character more orinetated towards being a carry.
      She NEEDS to reach 100 HC before rushing or it'll be a sad outcome from her, and her utility doesn't make up for the lack of it.
      She also has no real move to spam in her rotation, her multipliers just aren't that high for someone who is meant to be a carry._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Post Rush Regen.
      
      - Long Hit Count Extension
      
      - Big rush multiplier.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Awful ATK stat coupled with a conditional self buff.
      
      - Utility is quite weak.
   
      **Rotation**
      
      Normal > Rocket Punch > Hammer Slammer > Jump'n'Thump*3 (Replace Hammer Slammer with Force Field if 104 AP or higher)

  notes: >
      _Her offensive buffing is mediocre when considering the necessary ramp-up and lack of rush buff, but her damage output and hitcount racking is 
      solid, and she provides two welcome safety nets between her hitcount timer extension and potent party regen._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good damage.
      - Decent rush gain.
      - Fast hitcount generation, making her a good friend to units dependent on it.
      - Rare single target DMG buff.
      - Self crit buff on Rush for Crystal Guardian
      
      **Cons**
      - Long rush animation guaranteed to annoy your party.
      - Bow animations make kiting bosses harder than it needs to be, and she is often forced into that due to high aggro gen.
      - Underwhelming buffs, especially compared to shooters of similar strength.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Wing > Restrict > Wing^n - DPS*
      *Normal > Restrict > Wing > Wave^n - Rush*
      *Normal > Restrict > Wing > Restrict^n - DPS/Rush vs large enemies (9+ hits per Restrict)*
