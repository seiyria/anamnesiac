      _[v2] Very reasonable damage buffer with a unique set of buffs. Centered around buffing team mobility with dodge AP down and movespeed allows allies to maneuver around attacks more easily, and a post-rush heal allows him to keep the Nier units topped off for their buffs. He also comes with ATK damage on rush, which is uncommon at such a high value at the moment. That said, his skills are single hit and lack tracking, therefore his hit count racking is extremely weak. He is a sword user, making for a unique playstyle and allowing him to benefit from a select number of close range buffs, which would normally not be applied to shooters. His buffs align him with his full power, but he benefits the least, having dodged the nerf hammer prominently the first time around._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Fantastic personal damage for his role.

      - Talents increase party movility greatly.

      - Strong damage buff.

      - OHS wielder which means close range weapon talents affect him. Also has great elemental coverage.
      
      **Cons**
      
      - No ranged normals.

      - Bad at building and maintaining hitcount.

      - Skills mean he can whiff on highly mobile bosses.

      _Maria, the OG sharpshooter, the beginner character you should pick and the benchmark of what makes a sharpshooter good. Her
      playstyle is simple and many feel a bit boring but that's what makes her easy to pick up for beginner players. Maria has only
      two talents. One simply reduces the damage she takes by a pretty meaty 20% which means she can take a hit or two, a useful 
      trait to have considering she can end up getting aggro and having to kite. Her other talent is a massive 40% damage buff to
      the party and is the main reason she is deemed so strong by many players._
      
      _Post-rush Maria also cleanses enemies of any buffs they may have and gives a pretty big 40% crit rate buff to party members,
      further helping to increase damage output. On top of that she has Crimson Squall, a fantastic skill due to having a high hit
      count and amazing target tracking as well as having very long range. It makes Maria fantastic at building and maintaing hit
      count to help party wide rush gain._
      
      _Her downsides, well she provides no defensive utility to the party like other sharpshooters do. Her biggest weakness however
      is probably just her poor personal damage. Her DPS isn't great so she can't carry solo really, her damage is her party
      members so she's a character that requires good players on your team to get the best out of her._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good at building and maintaining hit count.

      - Good at kiting.

      - Strong damage buff.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Weak personal damage.

      - Lack of defensive utility for the party.

      _Poison is powerful, however it won't/can't always procure. Nel has decent damage and she provides a party wide -AP Cost which helps out some units. The minor crit buff can also helps boost party DPS ever so slightly. Great against units that don't resist poison. It should be noted that Nel also works decently against bosses with only 1 floor, as her AP cost reduction can amount to more rush gain in a single rotation._

      _Note: Regular Poison does 1.11% Max HP / 3 sec (Enemy / 10 s); Deadly Poison does 3.33% Max HP / 4 s (Enemy / 15 s)._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Poison damage is ridiculous.

      - Good general-purpose buffing.

      - Fastest rush gain in the game, enabling her to effectively erase boss mechanics on command.

      - Daggers are a great weapon, with excellent kiting ability.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Without poison vulnerability, her dps is abysmal.

      - A poorly played Nel can grief the party by resetting hitcount unnecessarily, 
        cutting elem bursts short or constantly interrupting the fight.

      - Repel+1 hampers her ability to assume Shooter's primary role: kiting.

      - High animation lock on her best rush generation move (Poisonous Terror).

      - Poisonous Blade is a horrible move with horrible tracking and a tiny hitbox, and her best dps relies on it.

      _Clair is a shooter with defender talents, and can subsitute for one in most cases, with -30% atk damage taken and anti-flinch for the party._

      _Her +80% Damage rush buff is the largest rush buff in the game (even in JP). Overall, her damage output and rush gain aren't amazing, but she brings a great set of tools to any party. She will fall off when defenders with better damage output start being added to the game._

      oriented Sharpshooter compared to someone like Maria. She does have a pity damage buff of 20% if you have nothing better 
      however. She has the highest INT damage taken reduction buff in the game, even on JP this hasn't been beaten at a pretty meaty
      40% reduction. Her post rush also cleanses conditions on party members and applies a regen buff, allowing her to act as a pseudo
      healer. This is especially true considering her ability to quickly rack up hit count and rush with skills like Sparrows and
      Squall. She also is immune to conditions and has a built in grit chance so she isn't that easy to kill._
      
      _As for her downsides, Reimi is despsided for the fact Rapacious Sparrows sends enemies sky high when stunned and can ruin
      melee getting their damage in so players need to be ready to switch their attack patterns. Her damage also isn't great like
      many SS but is passable, though her lack of meaningful offensive utility means she's more about making runs easier to clear
      then doing it with any sense of efficiency. Bows also have the issue of having some of the worst AI in the game so she's not
      really one you want to see on auto._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Highest INT damage taken reduction in the game.

      - Lots of defensive utility makes her a good psuedo healer.
      
      - Great at building and maintaining hit count as well as gaining rush.
      
      - Her talents and post rush buffs can make her quite hard to kill.
      

      **Cons**

      - Pity Damage buff is her only offensive utility.

      - Sparrows makes stunned enemies join them in the sky.

      - Bow AI.

      _[v2] Exciting buffs for everyone's favorite stupid looking cute dumb pink girl. Her damage buff becomes competitive again with her JP-level buffs, falling just short of MariaA, but above unawakened Maria. Nothing changes about her DPS, but it was mildly reasonable to begin with and only suffered from inconsistent damage against highly mobile targets. Party guts is a solid as always, and you can consider her conditionals/rush buff icing on the reasonable base she provides._

      _[Potential] Overall, she'll feel slightly more pub-proof thanks to her party guts. 70/20 is a great percentage to give innately, and will probably save someone's life during a run. That said, she is a bit clunky thanks to her bow skills/normals, so she loses a bit for that. You won't always have 100% AP as well, so that helps._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Party wide grit.

      - Big crit damage buff post rush.
      
      - Damage reduction that helps the aggro target.
      
      - Ap recovery on normals.
      
      - Good damage buff
      

      **Cons**

      - Buffing crit damage so much isn't that good when you buff crit rate so little.

      - Howling Wind is good but clunky to use.
      
      - Bow AI.

      _Just like her sister, she's not anything close to an upgrade, only an alternative to the units which are available. Both were unfortunately outshined by even the nerfed summer units, and do not do themselves any favours in terms of release schedule ordering. When not bringing ST DMG on another unit, Silmeria technically has the same buff amount as Maria, with a lower crit buff (self only). However, she does bring significantly more DMG (comparable to sMiki), and Hit Count + 2 paired with actual other talents (sorry, Emmerson, you'll get your time) means it will be hard to drop a hitcount combo, making rush gain much smoother in movement heavy/annoying bosses._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good damage.

      - Decent rush gain.

      - Fast hitcount generation, making her a good friend to units dependent on it.

      - Rare single target DMG buff.

      - Self crit buff on Rush for Crystal Guardian
      

      **Cons**

      - Long rush animation guaranteed to annoy your party.

      - Bow animations make kiting bosses harder than it needs to be, and she is often forced into that due to high aggro gen.

      - Underwhelming buffs, especially compared to shooters of similar strength.

      _[v2] HVic returns, getting one of the nastier buffs. Although solid healers are rampant on GL, his amount of lifesteal is impressive and easy to use to keep everyone topped off in medium-hard fights. With the new addition of another personal buff, his damage is competitive and his damage buffing is usable. For units whose weapons don't provide innate element damage, his aggregate pre-rush buffing is 55%, though this will usually get overriden due to post-rush elemental damage being common. Although his ST will usually not be useful, it does fill the gap between max ST damage uptime, even with current defenders._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good at building and maintaing Hit Count.

      - Provides three different type of damage buffs.

      - Great Synergy with 100% HP talent characters.

      - Provides both sustained healing and burst healing.
      

      **Cons**

      - Though damage is high for an SS leaves something to be wanted against other characters.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Cleave vs Shockwave - Preference. Cleave is ranged and passes through targets (trash clearing), Shockwave has close range CA which may be situationally useful.*

      _Pretty bad moveset and being the tester for the hybird gunner/caster class makes her very strange. Her DPS is low, she's non-ACE, and her buffing is subpar so her only real upside is that she's free for players during this event. That said, with Maria being an option for a starter unit, there's almost no reason to run her, unless you really want to try a caster comp for something._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good at building and maintaing Hit Count.

      - Decent damage buffs for Invokers and herself.
      
      - Free MLB non-ace 5 star.
      

      **Cons**

      - Non-ace so has less stats.

      - Moveset is poor with no real power move to spam.

      - Buffs are irrelevant on any non-caster character.

      _Absolutely absymal event unit. That said, her skills are actually very good, and her rush does have a fairly unique ATK down, which is a solid defensive debuff, in theory._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good at building and maintaing Hit Count.

      - Decent rush gain.

      - Effective against Humanoids.

      - Poison Immunity.

      - Unique and strong debuffs.
      
      - Free MLB non-ace 5 star.
      

      **Cons**

      - Non-ace so has less stats.

      - Deals underwhelming damage outside of humanoid fights.

      - Underwhelming buffs.

      _Element buffs pre-rush are still solid, and crit at a solid percentage is also nice, but her rush gain and damage are atrocious, and single-target has become oversaturated due to GL's limited release rate. In the end, her buffing is unneeded for the character package it comes with. That said, she has dual guns and may be reasonably fun to pilot._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong elemental damage buff.

      - Very strong post rush crit buff.
      

      **Cons**

      - Woeful Single Target Damage buff.

      - Ap Recovery is limited to being at long range.

      - Slow rush gain.

  notes: >
      _[v2] With her awakening, Maria shoots back up to the top with a very solid buff, no strings attached, in addition to some other goodies. Her attack gets buffed so she actually does real damage on her rush and abilities, in addition to an excellent new skill. Raptorshot is great for tracking and hitcount, with a bonus for lingering to abuse cancel bonuses. Her dash speed/distance is excellent for kiting, but make sure you get used to the new distance - don't overshoot into the enemy's attacks. Lastly, static AP recovery helps eliminate a lot of her downtime (and any other casters/shooters who might choose to wait vs attack for AP), and she gets innate sustain at 100 HC, which is easy to hit with Squall and Raptor._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good at building and maintaining hit count.

      - Good at kiting.

      - Best unconditional damage buff.
      
      - A good range of utility
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Lifesteal after hit count 100 can be irrelevant.
      
      
      **Rotation**

      *Normal > Squall > Aiming > Squall^n - Higher Rush Gain (Must be at distance, normal must hit after you use Squall.)*
      
      *Normal > Squall > Raptor > Squall^n - Rush Gain*

      *Normal > Raptor > Aiming > Raptor^n - DPS*

      _If she had one more buff, she'd be really good. As it is right now, her damage buff scales well, but is essentially outperformed by her awakened counterpart. Poor skillset and weak post-rush with any meta ATK buffer. That said, if you don't want to awaken Maria or use 9S, she's a reasonable damage buffer with excellent hitcount racking thanks to her version of Gravity Bullet. Released with JP re-release buffs._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good at building and maintaining hit count.

      - Good at kiting.

      - Strong damage buff. That grows to the strongest in the game.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Weak personal damage.

      - Lack of defensive utility for the party.

  notes: >
      _Hit count timer means better rush gain, attached with some reasonable buffs and decent hitcount racking. That said, her buffs don't kick in for a while, especially with the state of GL's hitcount racking. She does brings ATK Damage at its max %, which is still fairly uncommon. ST Damage also means that she substitutes for a Defender if needed. Gimped by a subpar moveset, but probably the best of the first wedding releases. Released with JP re-release buffs._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - +3 second hit count timer means you have to actually try to drop the count.

      - Buffs both crit rate and crit damage.

      - Meaty ATK damage buff post rush.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Weak personal damage.

      - Lack of defensive utility for the party.
      
      - Near pointless anti-flinch and Single Target damage buffs.
      
      
      **Rotation**

      *Normal > CA Shot > CA (Guillotine/Wheel) > CA Shot^n - Hit Count Build*
      
      *Normal > CA Guillotine > CA Shot > CA Guillotine^n - DMG. CAing keeps you in comfortable distance and targetting.*

      *Use Guillotine or Wheel depending on what range is preferred.*

      _Notably comes with fairly unique buffs, which are fairly specific to the Verda units with a few exceptions. Not a stellar damage buff with the new standard from awakened units, but it's reasonable if you consider her other buffing. Functionally discount 9S with much less damage, but a few bonuses which make her a reasonable alternative downgrade. Bonus against large enemies thanks to Bullet. On the whole, Verda's kit excels greatly against medium to large enemies, and can be awkward pitted against small enemies._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Applies Debuffs that aren't common.

      - Good at building and maintaining hit count.

      - Meaty ATK damage buff post rush.
      
      - Niche utility makes her good for Silence MoT maze and content with rush gauge fields.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Weak personal damage.

      - Lack of defensive utility for the party.
      
      - 30% Damage buff is bad with the popularity of Awakened or partially awakened Maria and 9S.
      
      
      **Rotation**

      *Normal > Gravity > Splitshot/Squall > Gravity^n - Larger targets, especially if Splitshot lands full hits.*
      
      *Normal > CA Field > Splitshot/Squall > Field^n - Targets too small for Gravity. Poorer rush gain, but Squall can make up some of it.*

      *Splitshot VS Squall - Preference. Range variety and dependant on enemy sizes.*

      _JKJK (high school aged Sophia in JP) finally arrives. Although her buffing is a bit redundant and slightly dated compared to units we have now, she brings other benefits in spades. The most prominent being hitcount racking, rush gain and personal damage; all heavily dependent on the notorious move "Gremlin's Lair" (a.k.a "hamsters"). Although her damage is standard and ST doesn't beat any Defenders, she does provide AP to anyone who would really want it, and a huge 90/30 guts to anyone who wouldn't. Long range parties also get the benefit of increased stun rate, even without Roddick. Although her rush is a bit weak, it refreshes guts and the buffing is slightly better than most sources of ATK damage._

      _[Potential] Due to her myriad of spread buffs, JKJK is particularly solid at pubbing, filling in three different damage buffs, as well as AP on norms and even guts/heal. You'd be perfectly fine bringing her into almost any comp, only really missing any attack buffer. She does well in premade comps as well, but this is where she particularly excels._

      _SLenneth comes at a strange time, as on paper she has a lot of aggregate buffing, but unfortunately, 2/3 of them are easily replaced or common and the last requires manual application.. Elemental damage is now a very vanilla post-rush buff, with a number of units providing it, and her measly damage buff is easily overwritten. She does stack decently with another shooter, and her own DPS multiplies twofold on large targets thanks to Killing Thorn's capability for extra hits in those situations._

      _[Potential] You know the drill, spread buffing is always better in pubs, so you're hitting maximum efficiency without having to rely on allies. SLenn's strongest buff, damage taken, will almost never be conflicting except in dupes, and her decent damage means she contributes decently._

      _Her offensive buffing is mediocre when considering the necessary ramp-up and lack of rush buff, but her damage output and hitcount racking is 
      solid, and she provides two welcome safety nets between her hitcount timer extension and potent party regen._

      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good damage.
      - Decent rush gain.
      - Fast hitcount generation, making her a good friend to units dependent on it.
      - Rare single target DMG buff.
      - Self crit buff on Rush for Crystal Guardian
      
      **Cons**
      - Long rush animation guaranteed to annoy your party.
      - Bow animations make kiting bosses harder than it needs to be, and she is often forced into that due to high aggro gen.
      - Underwhelming buffs, especially compared to shooters of similar strength.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Wing > Restrict > Wing^n - DPS*
      *Normal > Restrict > Wing > Wave^n - Rush*
      *Normal > Restrict > Wing > Restrict^n - DPS/Rush vs large enemies (9+ hits per Restrict)*
