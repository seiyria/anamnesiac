      _9S gets restored to his intial JP value on GL with the rerun and becomes by far the best SS with it. He now has the best flat
      damage buff in the game that gets better for players when they're at 100% HP. His personal damage output is quite high, made
      even higher with his damage buff. His attacks are still all one hit wonders, meaning he's best played at close range especially
      since he is restricted to melee normals. He gives the party high mobility and makes for a decent kite. His post rush heals 
      gives him additional utility. He is just pretty broken currently compared to every other SS in the game._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Fantastic personal damage for his role.

      - Talents increase party movility greatly.

      - Strong damage buff.

      - OHS wielder which means close range weapon talents affect him. Also has great elemental coverage.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - No ranged normals.

      - Bad at building and maintaining hitcount.

      - Skills mean he can whiff on highly mobile bosses.

      _Maria, the OG sharpshooter, the beginner character you should pick and the benchmark of what makes a sharpshooter good. Her
      playstyle is simple and many feel a bit boring but that's what makes her easy to pick up for beginner players. Maria has only
      two talents. One simply reduces the damage she takes by a pretty meaty 20% which means she can take a hit or two, a useful 
      trait to have considering she can end up getting aggro and having to kite. Her other talent is a massive 40% damage buff to
      the party and is the main reason she is deemed so strong by many players._
      
      _Post-rush Maria also cleanses enemies of any buffs they may have and gives a pretty big 40% crit rate buff to party members,
      further helping to increase damage output. On top of that she has Crimson Squall, a fantastic skill due to having a high hit
      count and amazing target tracking as well as having very long range. It makes Maria fantastic at building and maintaing hit
      count to help party wide rush gain._
      
      _Her downsides, well she provides no defensive utility to the party like other sharpshooters do. Her biggest weakness however
      is probably just her poor personal damage. Her DPS isn't great so she can't carry solo really, her damage is her party
      members so she's a character that requires good players on your team to get the best out of her._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good at building and maintaining hit count.

      - Good at kiting.

      - Strong damage buff.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Weak personal damage.

      - Lack of defensive utility for the party.

      _You could say there are two flavors of Nel Zepher: the flavor where the boss is vulnerable to poison and the flavor where the
      boss is not. Rare is a character who is this polarized by a singular detail._
      
      _A Nel against a poison-vulnerable boss has potential to be among the strongest dps in the game, capable of melting high HP bosses
      in seconds, on top of having incredible defensive utility and a great offensive buffing kit. If the boss can't be poisoned,
      her dps is among the worst in the game, and she becomes more of a support/utility character._
      
      _Thankfully, that utility is pretty good. Her fast rush gain enables her to basically erase anything a boss does that
      can feasibly be threatening with the only downside being a hitcount reset (which is granted, significant). Her AP reduction
      raises everyone's dps, and is commonly underestimated. Her crit+10% isn't incredible, but it's a nice bonus._
      
      _In the end, she's a character you probably won't bring to every boss. But when she's toxic, she is truly beautiful._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Poison damage is ridiculous.

      - Good general-purpose buffing.

      - Fastest rush gain in the game, enabling her to effectively erase boss mechanics on command.

      - Daggers are a great weapon, with excellent kiting ability.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Without poison vulnerability, her dps is abysmal.

      - A poorly played Nel can grief the party by resetting hitcount unnecessarily, 
        cutting elem bursts short or constantly interrupting the fight.

      - Repel+1 hampers her ability to assume Shooter's primary role: kiting.

      - High animation lock on her best rush generation move (Poisonous Terror).

      - Poisonous Blade is a horrible move with horrible tracking and a tiny hitbox, and her best dps relies on it.

      _Emmerson, the bottom of the barrel SS till he gets his awakening. He has some positives, his talents mean his normals pack a
      bit of extra punch, and he has benefits to comps built around the hit counter. He also has a pretty big post rush ATK buff
      for himself, so he'll be a decent assist in the future too._
      
      _The downsides, well he is providing little to no utility to the party aside from his hit count extension, and that is kind of
      the main theme of the sharpshooter role, to be buffers. On top of that he's a gun wielder who doesn't have a ranged combo 
      which means lots of CA usage which has a lot of risks, not only due to the penatly if you get hit but you may normal at short
      range as a gun user. Which is suicidal in harder content.
      
      _Emmerson is just bad, one day he'll shine, but currently he is just, bad. Not utterly worthless but I wouldn't recommend using
      him unless you're a masochist._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Big hit count extension.

      - Strong personal ATK buff post rush.

      **Cons**
      
      - Almost no utility.

      - Lacks a ranged combo as a gun wielder.

      _Clair is the original tank. The OG kite character. Even now for she is one and perhaps even the best non-ace character in the
      game. She follows a different line of thinking for sharpshooters with her talents, being defensive utility instead of offensive
      utility. Though her post rush damage is still the highest damage buff in the game of 80%, which is pretty huge. Her talents give
      the party anti-flinch without needing a defender and arguably her best aspect is her ATK damage taken buff. This has yet to
      be bettered, even on JP which is over a year ahead giving her a unique defensive niche that she will always give to any party
      that includes her. She is a solid kite, able to use sylvan shot in particular with it's slight tracking to deal damage as she
      moves, while victory terror deals good damage and has good rush gain when she's not got aggro._
      
      _Clair does have her downsides. Victory Terror is her best move but without the ability dodge in the air it is risky to use
      especially when you're the aggro target which can gimp her damage considerably. Also just being non-ace means her stats
      themselves are lesser. Plus while post-rush she helps bring the pain she isn't a good option if you're looking for someone to
      help the party deal damage in the same way Maria can for instance._
      
      _In summary Clair is a fantastic character and one worth considering taking to MLB due to being cheaper to limit break and augment
      which makes her an option worth considering for newer players wanting a decent character early. She is also pretty future proof
      with her assist and her eventual awakening both being quite powerful._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Anti-flinch for the party. No defender required.

      - The best ATK damage reduction buff in the game.

      - The best post rush damage buff in the game.

      - Daggers are a great weapon, with excellent kiting ability.

      **Cons**
      
      - Lacks offensive buffs pre-rush.

      - High animation lock on her best rush generation move (Victory Terror)

      - Non-ace so has less stats.

      _Reimi joins the fray as the first ace bow wielder and to get people tilted by a flock of birds. Reimi is a much more defensive
      oriented Sharpshooter compared to someone like Maria. She does have a pity damage buff of 20% if you have nothing better 
      however. She has the highest INT damage taken reduction buff in the game, even on JP this hasn't been beaten at a pretty meaty
      40% reduction. Her post rush also cleanses conditions on party members and applies a regen buff, allowing her to act as a pseudo
      healer. This is especially true considering her ability to quickly rack up hit count and rush with skills like Sparrows and
      Squall. She also is immune to conditions and has a built in grit chance so she isn't that easy to kill._
      
      _As for her downsides, Reimi is despsided for the fact Rapacious Sparrows sends enemies sky high when stunned and can ruin
      melee getting their damage in so players need to be ready to switch their attack patterns. Her damage also isn't great like
      many SS but is passable, though her lack of meaningful offensive utility means she's more about making runs easier to clear
      then doing it with any sense of efficiency. Bows also have the issue of having some of the worst AI in the game so she's not
      really one you want to see on auto._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Highest INT damage taken reduction in the game.

      - Lots of defensive utility makes her a good psuedo healer.
      
      - Great at building and maintaining hit count as well as gaining rush.
      
      - Her talents and post rush buffs can make her quite hard to kill.
      

      **Cons**

      - Pity Damage buff is her only offensive utility.

      - Sparrows makes stunned enemies join them in the sky.

      - Bow AI.

      _Miki puts on her bikini to show us her summer body and is a rather uniqe bow ace sharpshooter. Her talents are quite conditional
      much like Summer Myuria. She helps the aggro target by giving them ATK damage reduction, and helps out damage dealers by
      giving a crit rate boost but only if your behind the target. Now with summer her AP recovery on normals is 100% which is a
      pretty huge buff. Her damage buff is now quite good at 45% and the amazing buff she gives is still that 70/20 grit chance to
      the party which will make her much better for the party. On top of all this her post rush crit damage boost is pretty good
      and she now has a stronger rush. She'll stilll struggle with mobile targets but her damage output will stll be respectable._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Party wide grit.

      - Big crit damage buff post rush.
      
      - Damage reduction that helps the aggro target.
      
      - Ap recovery on normals.
      
      - Good damage buff
      

      **Cons**

      - Buffing crit damage so much isn't that good when you buff crit rate so little.

      - Howling Wind is good but clunky to use.

      _Come to me, dark warriors, obsolescence awaits us!_
      
      _Silmeria arrived in an unfortunate position out the gate. Bound by the high expectations following Maria and Clair, gagged by
      the fact that everyone owned the former. The only way Silmeria could have avoided what followed is if she had strong talents,
      damage and kiting ability. Well, she does bring damage. Unfortunately, she is luckluster on the rest._
      
      _Her buffing is average at best; while it's nice that she has Single Target DMG at all, 10% is barely noticeable and underwhelming
      compared to Maria's crit chance buffs or Clair's anti-flinch. Kiting with her is a pain due to bow's generally terrible animations
      and mechanics, with nothing to help her AP recovery. And she WILL be kiting, because she has ridiculous aggro generation._
      
      _She is best run with a defender so she can focus on doing what she does best: damage._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good damage.

      - Decent rush gain.

      - Fast hitcount generation, making her a good friend to units dependent on it.

      - Rare single target DMG buff.

      - Self crit buff on Rush for Crystal Guardian
      

      **Cons**

      - Long rush animation guaranteed to annoy your party.

      - Bow animations make kiting bosses harder than it needs to be, and she is often forced into that due to high aggro gen.

      - Underwhelming buffs, especially compared to shooters of similar strength.

      _Victor puts on a vampire costume that makes him an Ace and also pretty godly. Halloween Victor even though he has been nerfed
      is still the only sharpshooter to rival 9S for the top spot but is great for different reasons. Halloween Victor has a plethora
      of buffs both offensive and defensive giving him well rounded utility. He provides a 30% damage buff and a conditional 10% buff
      to elemental damage, which is a rare buff in GL. Post rush he also adds a 40% single target damage buff for the party on top
      which means he is stacking 3 different damage type buffs._ 
      
      _His defensive utility also helps maintain that 100% HP, giving all
      party members a 10% life steal effect on their normals as well as healing by 40% of Max HP for the party post rush. He keeps
      himself even healthier by having healing based on his skill damage and an AP reduction buff based on skill chain helps him
      spam skills to make him good at building and maintaining hit count._
      
      _As for downside his biggest is that his personal damage is nothing to boast about. However this isn't uncommon among 
      sharpshooters and compared to those in his role it's pretty reasonable. It's very hard to really find much of a fault in Hvic's
      tool kit beyond the fact his damage could be better but with all the buffs he's providing you don't really care that much.
      HVic is just a great example of what you want your buffing sharpshooters to bring._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good at building and maintaing Hit Count.

      - Provides three different type of damage buffs.

      - Great Synergy with 100% HP talent characters.

      - Provides both sustained healing and burst healing.
      

      **Cons**

      - Though damage is high for an SS leaves something to be wanted against other characters.

      _Lymle rejoins the fight to tell us that other version of her is a bootleg unofficial version. Official Lymle is a unique
      characters, a science experiement by the devs to test out gun casters who aren't invokers but Sharpshooters. It wasn't
      successful but it is at least interesting. Official Lymle is meant to go into a caster party, with her damage buff of 25% 
      increasing to 35% for herself and healers plus invokers. She also gives a weak but not irrelevant 20% cast time reduction
      to the party. Plunging firebolt is also not a terrible move for hit count since it tracks and has low cost so she can do
      that part of the sharpshooter role pretty well. Post rush she boosts her own and invoker damage by 60% which is not a small
      amount._
      
      _However outside of a very specific composition OLymle kind of falls apart. Her buffs are weak or irrelevant to non-casters.
      Even then many invokers and healers come with casting reduction. Also her moveset is pretty poor. The moves stand along
      aren't terrible, they see use on other characters, the problem is she has essentially gotten 4 filler moves for a move set.
      Plus the animation lock with guns when casting is still not great, plus she feels a bit odd to play but may be worth taking
      for a try out if you're bored._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good at building and maintaing Hit Count.

      - Decent damage buffs for Invokers and herself.
      
      - Free MLB non-ace 5 star.
      

      **Cons**

      - Non-ace so has less stats.

      - Moveset is poor with no real power move to spam.

      - Buffs are irrelevant on any non-caster character.

      _Clair joins us as a freebie for Valentine in Tri-Aces gift to us by giving us an alt of best girl. She also isn't that bad of
      a free unit and continues the Clair trend of having some defensive utility in her talents or post rush. She's a solid character
      who's combat style is similar to that of Maria, relying heavily on how good Crimson Squall is. This actually makes her good at
      building up and maintaining hit count, while also giving her decent rush gain. She's a humanoid specialist with her inbuilt
      humanoid slayer and has a built in AP reduction allowing her to spam moves even more._ 
      
      _She provides poison immunity to the party meaning she has a niche in MoT and against certain bosses like the valentine boss 
      she releases alongside. Her real power lays in her post rush buff, a rare 30 second duration and pretty rare debuffs. While 
      lowering enemy DEF isn't that big a damage boost unless you have no crit buffing, in theory lowering ATK is a pretty good
      debuff for defensive utility._
      
      _Her downsides are that she doesn't provide much other than her debuffs and poison immunity to the party, and poison immunity
      is pretty niche even if it's nice to have. Her personal damage isn't going to blow you away just like most SS and unlike Maria
      her talents don't make up for it as much, though on Humanoid bosses she should be pretty solid. Just overall she isn't a
      spectacular character but like some of our other recent freebies she's okay and very much a playable character even in harder
      content._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good at building and maintaing Hit Count.

      - Decent rush gain.

      - Effective against Humanoids.

      - Poison Immunity.

      - Unique and strong debuffs.
      
      - Free MLB non-ace 5 star.
      

      **Cons**

      - Non-ace so has less stats.

      - Deals underwhelming damage outside of humanoid fights.

      - Underwhelming buffs.

      _Anne finally arrives to show how much better the Official version is compared to her boot leg non-ace version. Though she comes
      up kind of short. Anne suffers from being the first dual gun wielder on JP. While on GL we've been spoiled with Winter Fidel
      Anne was the test subject for the new play style which adds some clunkiness to it. She does have her plus points, pre-rush
      elemental damage buffs aren't super common on GL, especially at such a high %. Plus her post rush crit rate continues the Anne
      tradition of being extremely high for GL, not as high as her non-ace version but 50% is still very high._
      
      _However Anne's other talents are just bad, her single target damage buff beats none of the top defenders in the game currently
      and it's even tied to a condition of being short range. Then her AP recovery talent requires players to be at long range so
      it's good for casters but that's about it since SS will generally normal for AP recovery. Her damage is passable for an SS but
      the lack of quality buffs really hurt her, it doesn't help that dual guns are a bit awkward to use due to their normals being
      more midrange unlike most of their skills which can hit at a much further distance._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong elemental damage buff.

      - Very strong post rush crit buff.
      

      **Cons**

      - Woeful Single Target Damage buff.

      - Ap Recovery is limited to being at long range.

      - Slow rush gain.

      _Just as 9S thought he was the undisputed champion of Sharshooters, Maria awoke to back hand him and remind him who the original
      queen was. Welcome to Maria Ocean! Maria's awakening gives her a plethora of new goodies but lets start with commenting on the 
      additions to her current kit. Every single skill recieves a boost to their mults, nothing major but still it increases damage.
      Her rush has also been boosted from a 3k to 4k multiplier. Her baseline damage boost is increased from 40 to 50% meaning she has
      the largest unconditional buff in the game. Plus her ATK and HP have both been buffed to increase her damage output and bulk._
      
      _Now lets cover her new toys. Maria now cuts evasion costs by 50% for the whole party. Her own personal evasion has been both
      sped up and increased in distance, couple this with her HP buff and damage reduction talent and Maria is looking pretty good
      for kiting. She also gains party wide lifesteal but only if the hit count is 100 or more. This isn't as good as it seems as
      you usually rush shortly after triple digits unless you're specifically aiming for a hit count buff, such as Winter Fidel's ATK
      damage buff at 200 hits. So the relevance of that talent is limited. Finally she also provides standing AP recovery and a slight
      AP reduction, however -5% is pretty big for Maria as it allows her to do her rotations without AP seeds. Though it is recommended
      to have 1 or 2 in her to dodge with after a full rotation._
      
      _In summary Awakened Maria has a lot more utility and damage now that makes what was already a good character, pretty insane.
      With very few negative points._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good at building and maintaining hit count.

      - Good at kiting.

      - Best unconditional damage buff.
      
      - A good range of utility
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Lifesteal after hit count 100 can be irrelevant.

      _So Bridal Maria has arrived at the same time as her awakened form which is bad since Bridal was at least on paper an improved
      version of Maria. However that doesn't mean she's a terrible character. She has the highest damage buff in the game at 60%.
      Though it does require 200 hits to achieve this, Bridal Maria is capable of racking up the hits, especially since her version
      of gravity bullet is different from the one we know with some tracking on it and is great against larger enemies. She also gets
      a pretty big AP reduction and slight ATK buff once past 50 hits. Plus she does add a little extra damage to everyones normals
      for a slight dps increase. Her post rush buff gives 60% ATK which means she doesn't need to worry about 2bs conditional._
      
      _Now for downsides. The 200 hit condition is a mighty buff and to match Awakened Maria she needs 100 hits and 150 hits to
      match 9S for their best damage buffs. Her flat damage buff is just the Maria one. Her ATK post rush buff is kind of meh
      considering 2b exists and that awakened Fidel is coming with a flat 50% buff as well. Her lack of Squall hurts and it's
      replacement in burst Emissions is pretty bad. Also her rush has been bugged in JP since release and it doesn't contribute to
      Elemental Burst. Which hurts even more so as it would have made her better against light weak bosses. In summary Bridal Maria
      is a good enough unit, but she is outclassed and to get the best out of her requires more work then it seems worth._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good at building and maintaining hit count.

      - Good at kiting.

      - Strong damage buff. That grows to the strongest in the game.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Weak personal damage.

      - Lack of defensive utility for the party.
      
      
      **Rotation**

  notes: >
      _When I originally looked at Bridal Nel I thought she wasn't so bad, apart from her splash art, god it's ugly.
      Then I happened to look at Xprecis and realised they shared
      a lot of similar talents but Bridal Nel's is just twice the work. However crit damage buffers are rare and she won't drop hit
      count unless you actually try to so you can rest easy knowing you can get to 200. So it's not an utter write off and the two
      characters play different roles. Her AP reduction is a nice perk, though her anti-flinch seems pretty meidocre given it's low 
      percent and her small HP pool. She has a nice 30% ATK buff on CA but that comes with risk. Her biggest bonus is her post rush.
      The 40% ATK damage buff to the party is very good by GL standards and since we don't really run INT users outside of sometimes
      seeing healers will always be good. Plus the single target damage buff means she gives a good variety for pubbing._
      
      _However Bridal Nel just isn't that amazing, she's just good. She will also be outclassed by the first decent crit buffer we
      get that isn't a healer. Her damage output is bad, her single target damage is matched or beaten by almost every defender you
      commonly see. There just doesn't seem to be a good reason to run Nel outside of getting a big ATK damage buff post rush in GL._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - +3 second hit count timer means you have to actually try to drop the count.

      - Buffs both crit rate and crit damage.

      - Meaty ATK damage buff post rush.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Weak personal damage.

      - Lack of defensive utility for the party.
      
      - Near pointless anti-flinch and Single Target damage buffs.

    notes: >
      _Verda stops giving out chocolate to actually join as a permanent character and another single gun wielding ace. Like her 
      valentine version, Verda is a debuffer, she gives the ever so slightest debuff to enemy attack that isn't all that relevant
      due to how small it is, though her 15% damage debuff is a lot more interesting as the only person it will conflict with
      currently is vwelch and an end to earth content should see vwelch decline in popularity somewhat. She has a pity damage buff
      as well but with the prominence of Awakened Maria and 9S that's likely to get overlapped. Her silence immunity gives a MoT
      niche that she can fill, and reducing rush gauge fields, even if only to certain characters, it a nice utility perk as well._
      
      _On top of all of this Verda gets a pretty good post rush buff, increasing movement speed short term is okay, though you
      generally want that perk the whole fight, but only Bridal Nel can beat the ATK damage buff she comes packing which gives a pretty
      good reason to bring her into a comp as your damage buffer and a debuffer._
      
      _To summarize, Verda isn't overwhelmingly strong, but she does a few things that beat out most other characters, or are only done
      by so few characters that the overlap chance is slim which means she'll be good for debuffing. She has a good enough skill set
      that for now, she isn't a bad character to be using as you'll always be giving something to the party unless you've somehow
      ended up with Vwelch, Bridal Nel and Maria/9S.
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Applies Debuffs that aren't common.

      - Good at building and maintaining hit count.

      - Meaty ATK damage buff post rush.
      
      - Niche utility makes her good for Silence MoT maze and content with rush gauge fields.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Weak personal damage.

      - Lack of defensive utility for the party.
      
      - 30% Damage buff is bad with the popularity of Awakened or partially awakened Maria and 9S.
      
      
      **Rotation**

      *Normal > Break Bullet > Crimson Squall > Break Bullet > Spam Till Out of AP (General Damage On Large Targets)*
      
      *Normal > Magnetic Field > Crimson Squall > Magnetic Field > Spam Till Out of AP (General Damage On Small Targets)*

  notes: >
      _Her offensive buffing is mediocre when considering the necessary ramp-up and lack of rush buff, but her damage output and hitcount racking is 
      solid, and she provides two welcome safety nets between her hitcount timer extension and potent party regen._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good damage.
      - Decent rush gain.
      - Fast hitcount generation, making her a good friend to units dependent on it.
      - Rare single target DMG buff.
      - Self crit buff on Rush for Crystal Guardian
      
      **Cons**
      - Long rush animation guaranteed to annoy your party.
      - Bow animations make kiting bosses harder than it needs to be, and she is often forced into that due to high aggro gen.
      - Underwhelming buffs, especially compared to shooters of similar strength.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Wing > Restrict > Wing^n - DPS*
      *Normal > Restrict > Wing > Wave^n - Rush*
      *Normal > Restrict > Wing > Restrict^n - DPS/Rush vs large enemies (9+ hits per Restrict)*
