  notes: >
      _Sophia is an interesting caster, with a huge INT stat and some decent spells to back it up. She's mainly locked to fire, but actually for offensive use only, brings an excellent ATK buff skill for physical parties while having enough power to sustain herself. A generally viable self-sufficient caster who gives herself everything that she needs to work. Very flexible, especially in pubs._
            
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      - In combat ATK buff.
      - Good buffs for Invokers and healers.
      - Talents make her self sufficient and doesn't require party synergy.
      - Fire Bolt is a homing attack.
      
      **Cons**
      - Talents are greedy outside of a caster composition.
      - Hard locked into fire. Has no real secondary element.
      - Staff casting.

      **Rotation**
      *Normal > CA Explosion > Fire Bolt > Explosion > Explosion (General damage rotation. Recommended with 101 AP.)*
      *Normal > CA Fire Bolt > Explosion > Fire Bolt (Moving target rotation.)*

      _Standard thunder caster. Staff casting means slow spells, she has no party buffing whatsoever, so her only merit is Plasma Cyclone and some extra stun rate for herself only. Unimpressive rush gain and damage pre-rush. Not nearly as impressive with other invokers in the pool to compete with her. Will need to wait for awakening to see herself in the meta again._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      - Plasma Cyclone for great AoE
      - Good stun rate buff.
      - Talents make her self sufficient and doesn't require party synergy.
      - Deals good damage.
      
      **Cons**
      - Talents are greedy.
      - High AP costs.
      - Staff casting.
      - Slow rush gain.

      **Rotation**
      *Normal x 2 > CA Cyclone > Dash Cancel (After seeing animation start.)^n - Rush Gain Only, Especially Mobs*
      *Normal > CA Flare > Plasma > Flare *

  notes: >
      _Bad everything. Huge AP costs, long cast times, horrid stats, and all his spells are slow and inaccurate. +40% INT is admittedly the largest party INT buff available, but it has limited utility as most invokers will buff their own INT much higher on rush. Notably also reduces cast time, which is decent. If you're soloing and just expecting your AI characters to die, his buff can be made useful, but he's really not a character you want to have to play. 
      [Potential] - Slightly better as a buffbot if you were to run a theoretical caster comp. Celine still does the job better, but Ronyx does give cast redux, which not everyone has._
      
      **TL DR**

      **Pros**
      - Strong party wide INT buff.
      - Reduces cast times by 50% post rush.
      - Non-ace so cheaper to MLB and augment.
      
      **Cons**
      - Slow cast times with expensive spells which can miss.
      - Abysmal AI.
      - Non-ace so has less stats.
      
      **Rotation**
      *Normal x 3 > CA Volcanic/Explosion > Dash Cast > CA Volcanic/Explosion - Rush Gain (Best combo to support team overall.)*

      _Lymle is a generic fire caster who will continue to get outscaled, kay? Her damage post-rush is quite good and she does have generally pretty good spells, but her base stats and lack of offensive buffing make her a subpar pick, since casters shouldn't need defensive buffing without the aid of a Defender anyway._

      - No party wide talent or post rush buffs.

      _A total oddball; despite being a caster, he uses a melee weapon and has two close-range spells (though Reap Spark works from long range too), and despite
      being a non-ace he has high base INT, potent partywide single target damage and stun rate buffs, as well as very fast casting and 80/10 guts. He's also the 
      only source of Curse, which effectively compensates his damage output - which thanks to a potent event weapon, isn't even bad. He's a staple invoker,
      and being a non-ace with a readily available F2P weapon makes him highly accessible. 102 AP is recommended for his full combo._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      - Non-ace so cheaper to MLB and augment.
      - Has good damage output, especially for a non-ace.
      - Can inflict curse.
      - Good party wide buffs and a grit talent to help him live.
      
      **Cons**
      - Locked into dark.
      - Extremely squishy.
      - Melee normals and short ranged spells can make him awkward to play.
      - Non-ace so has less stats.

      _Standard light caster. She does have Plasma Cyclone as a backup spell, which is great for Maze and trash floors. Starlight also does the same thing, but on her main element for her. Solid subtitute for Ronyx in a caster comp, as she does have a respectable INT buff to all. She is a staff caster, but does come bundled with cast time redux, thankfully. Decent for what she does, but shines in a caster comp._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      - Plasma Cyclone for great AoE
      - Party wide INT buff for caster comps
      - Can silence enemies.
      - Deals good damage.
      
      **Cons**
      - Doesn't bring much aside from her INT buff.
      - High AP costs.
      - Staff casting.
      
      **Rotation**

      *Normal > CA Starlight > Filler > Starlight^n*
      *Filler: Sunflare for DMG. Plasma Cyclone for crowd control. Enhance for buff.*

      _As far as invokers go, she ain't bad. Being an orb caster means she suffers less from having clunky cast times, and a double-dipping INT buff helps her a bit, while also boosting any healers/other invokers in the party. She does even come with some team utility, and a relatively unique buff still as well, not commonly seen pre-rush. While DEF down is subpar, it does help a little and helps both physical and magical DPS. Will be solid for dark /unresisted content. Notably has pretty good HC racking thanks to Needles spam earlier her combo._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      - Orb casting.
      - Good buffs for casting comps.
      - Deals good damage.
      - Has homing attacks.
      
      **Cons**
      - Dark focused caster.
      - Other party members may struggle to make use of her skill chain talent.

      **Rotation**
      *Normal > CA Shadow Exinction > Ice Needles > Shadow Needles (General damage rotation for mobile or large enemies.)*
      *Normal > CA Shadow Exinction > Shadow Needles > Shadow Exinction (General damage rotation for multiple or small enemies.)*

  notes: >
      _Probably one of the better free units for his purposes. 25% INT is a very reasonable buff for casters, if you happen to be running more than one, and the multitarget damage is situational and subpar, but may give you a bit of extra damage when there are bosses with mobs. His spell set is okay._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      - Great party wide INT buff.
      - Has spells which track enemies.
      - Free MLB non-ace.
      
      **Cons**
      - Lacks much utility.
      - Abysmal AI.
      - Non-ace so has less stats.

      *Normal > CA Plunging Fire Bolts > Ice Needles > Volcanic Burst > Spam till out of AP (Fire Rotation)*
      *Normal > CA Plunging Fire Bolts > Ice Needles > Arctic Impact > Spam till out of AP (Ice Rotation)*

  notes: >
      _Go to ice caster. She runs orb, which means compartively faster casts, made faster when on element due to only needing a single spell before canceling. Her unique buff makes her a one-shot wonder, so you can trigger it, then use 150% CA Artic Impacts for solid damage, while not losing mobility/kiting power. She offers nothing to the team, but is safer than other invokers and has a sky-high INT, which means she doesn't need any extra support. Aurora Rings has the potential to completely nuke certain slow/large bosses._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      - Orb casting.
      - Unique play style.
      - Deals high damage, very good against ice weak enemies.
      - Ap recovery buff for the party.
      
      **Cons**
      - Locked in on Ice.
      - Arctic Impact can send stunned enemies up high. It can also whiff against mobile foes.

      **Rotation**
      *Normal > CA Lancer > Hail - Self Buff*
      *Normal > CA Arctic - DC after first hit and repeat while buffed. You can skirt a normal around 80 AP and go straight into the next CA. With good timing can get up to 4 Arctics during buff.*
      *Normal > CA Aurora > Lancer > Aurora - Light Weak/Large Targets*

      _Earth main element caster carry. She has a dirty rush, and that's about it. Her talents support her personal damage, which, unless a caster brings significant party buffing, is totally fine. That said, she suffers from being element locked and is staff casting, making her innately slow. The only thing she brings otherwise is AP on normals, which isn't the worst sole-party buff to have._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      - High damage
      - Ap recovery buff on normal for the party.
      
      **Cons**
      - Earth focused.
      - Staff cast times with small cast reduction.
      - Crush is a terrible spell for your filler earth spell.
      - Provides almost nothing to the party. What she does give has been beaten by 3 characters.

      _An awkward case of usable buffing but terrible skills and weapon type. She looks good on paper, but is much worse in practice. Crit rate and damage, but relies on hitting her two main skills, which are both slow and prone to miss on small/fast targets. Healing is nice, but it's not very high and isn't worth bringing her solely for this._

      _Celine takes the cake for the second batch of awakenings. Her damage is buffed to a well reasonable level, nabbing a stat buff, self talents and a few other goodies (the only stat buff of batch 2, in fact). Her rush buff persists in being unimpressive, it's a slight damage boost still, but her rush damage itself now matches an average carry. Her biggest bonus is Enhance, which now means she's not completely void of party buffing in a regular ATK-based comp, in addition to putting out the same damage as a fully buffed carry without needing any supplements._

      _Our first shota arrives, and he's also our first ever mixed ATK/INT buffer. His ATK, while not near modern values at all, is still reasonable and particularly decent in a dark caster comp to buff the shooter. He still outputs excellent damage, and even brings AP RCV for a shooter if they don't have any innately, making him a reasonable flex slot choice, if not extremely optimal. Post rush amps his damage even more and makes him smoother to play thanks to the cast time redux. Slotting a bit of AP redux gives him two Shadow Flares, which is significant. Tome casts means solid kiting and mobility.

      [Potential] Just like his sister release unit JKJK, Leon is a pubproof unit, essentially filling for the Enhance invokers without needing to upkeep the buff. He also brings an additional party buff which can actually be quite useful, unlike most other invokers, and as a bonus, also amps healer's heals, if they need it._

      _A highly mobile and fast attacking Invoker who is range versatile and closer to an Attacker in playstyle. Her buffs are similar to Leon, giving mixed ATK/INT buffing. That said, it's better to consider her a carry who brings some potential party help rather than a buffer in her own right, unless in the rare caster comp. Her orbs can be imbued, but unfortunately she's innately light, and won't get more elementals until further down the line. 

      [Potential] Good self damage and an existent party buff for ATK based units makes her better in pubs than premades, though for most purposes Leon actually fills the dual buff role a bit better._

      _Uniquely provides full values of ATK/INT DMG pre-rush, and at the moment almost uniquely provides the INT DMG compared to existing buffs. A bit of crit rate/dmg tops this off, as well as some post rush AP utility. That said, she does suffer from staff casting, despite her cast redux (though dash canceling helps with Javelin). Her damage isn't amazing, but she does her job.

      [Potential] Extremely uncommon spread buffs, but still a staff caster. Good in most parties, but requires some skill and awareness as a pilot._

  notes: >
      _Unconditionally the best VP unit. The first to introduce INT -> ATK conversion, which functions as an addtional 20% ATK buff which stacks on regular ATK buffing. Lezard himself brings excellent hitcount, elemental versatility anddamage, even off-element, if necessary. Both of his elements are very solid, unlike other casters who lack a bit in their off-elements. Tome casting makes him mobile and safe, and his HC and rush gain together give him a safety button. Innate self-crit, ATK inflation and good rush gain make him particularly excellent for difficult fights._

      *Prismatic Missile and Shadow Servant are interchangeable depending on weakness/preference. Alternatively, Cross can be dropped if there is little reason for crit or crit is provided elsewhere.*
