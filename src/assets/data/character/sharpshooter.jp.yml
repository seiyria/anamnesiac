  notes: >
      _Just as 9S thought he was the undisputed champion of Sharshooters, Maria awoke to back hand him and remind him who the original
      queen was. Welcome to Maria Ocean! Maria's awakening gives her a plethora of new goodies but lets start with commenting on the 
      additions to her current kit. Every single skill recieves a boost to their mults, nothing major but still it increases damage.
      Her rush has also been boosted from a 3k to 4k multiplier. Her baseline damage boost is increased from 40 to 50% meaning she has
      the largest unconditional buff in the game. Plus her ATK and HP have both been buffed to increase her damage output and bulk._
      
      _Now lets cover her new toys. Maria now cuts evasion costs by 50% for the whole party. Her own personal evasion has been both
      sped up and increased in distance, couple this with her HP buff and damage reduction talent and Maria is looking pretty good
      for kiting. She also gains party wide lifesteal but only if the hit count is 100 or more. This isn't as good as it seems as
      you usually rush shortly after triple digits unless you're specifically aiming for a hit count buff, such as Winter Fidel's ATK
      damage buff at 200 hits. So the relevance of that talent is limited. Finally she also provides standing AP recovery and a slight
      AP reduction, however -5% is pretty big for Maria as it allows her to do her rotations without AP seeds. Though it is recommended
      to have 1 or 2 in her to dodge with after a full rotation._
      
      _In summary Awakened Maria has a lot more utility and damage now that makes what was already a good character, pretty insane.
      With very few negative points._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good at building and maintaining hit count.

      - Good at kiting.

      - Best unconditional damage buff.
      
      - A good range of utility
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Lifesteal after hit count 100 can be irrelevant.
      
      
      **Rotation**

  notes: >
      _Poison is powerful...when it works.  After awakening, Nel herself is also now powerful though, in addition to finally providing damage buffs alongside
      her crit and AP reduction.  In normal circumstances she's fairly average, but against larger enemies Aqua Spread combined with her new skill chain
      damage boosts reaches disgusting levels of damage.  So long as she can either inflict poison reliably or get 3+ hits with Aqua Spread, she's worth 
      your time now.  Otherwise, don't bother._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Poison damage is ridiculous.

      - Good general-purpose buffing.

      - Fastest rush gain in the game, enabling her to effectively erase boss mechanics on command.

      - Daggers are a great weapon, with excellent kiting ability.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Without poison vulnerability, her dps is abysmal.

      - A poorly played Nel can grief the party by resetting hitcount unnecessarily, 
        cutting elem bursts short or constantly interrupting the fight.

      - Repel+1 hampers her ability to assume Shooter's primary role: kiting.

      - High animation lock on her best rush generation move (Poisonous Terror)

      - Poisonous Blade is a horrible move with horrible tracking and a tiny hitbox, and her best dps relies on it.

  notes: >
      _Awakening Emmerson turns him from a joke to a functional character, giving him party Damage buffing and AP reduction.  He was also the founder
      of the "additional hits on skills" buff, giving him incredible hitcount generation, though he fell out of favor hard for this once Caleen introduced giving
      this buff partywide.  His selfish crit, ATK on rush, and AP refill on perfect dodge talents make him a decent pick for pub play, as they let him not
      have to worry about the rest of the party's buffing to get things done.  What you will need to worry about is his skillset; Hunter's Moon is his only
      skill with decent numbers on it, and for it to hit consistently it wants to both be used close to the target to compensate its slow projectile speed and
      for the target to wait around inside its explosion.  He also has a horrendous dash skid, meaning you'll want +AP on normals or to perfect dodge
      every time to compensate.  If you're willing to play around these faults he's a decent pub pick, though recent shooter carries exist that are both
      stronger and easier to play._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Big hit count extension.

      - Strong personal ATK buff post rush.
      
      - Non-ace so cheaper to limit break and augment.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Almost no utility.

      - Lacks a ranged combo as a gun wielder.

      - Non-ace so has less stats.

  notes: >
      _Absurd damage reduction both in general and especially for whoever's holding aggro, and an insanely potent and easy to upkeep rush buff.
      It should be stressed that whoever has aggro is given more damage mitigation by Clair's talents alone than from any single postrush Defender; she
      enables hits to be survived even in multiplayer Supremacy.  Providing no offensive buffs pre-rush hurts her desirability for short fights and speedrun
      comps, but she's excellent for survival and a major asset for longlasting fights.  All five of her skills are useful, so she can be customized to player 
      preference._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Anti-flinch for the party. No defender required.

      - The best ATK damage reduction buff in the game.

      - The best post rush damage buff in the game.

      - Daggers are a great weapon, with excellent kiting ability.
      
      - Non-ace so cheaper to limit break and augment.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Lacks offensive buffs pre-rush.

      - High animation lock on her best rush generation move (Victory Terror)

      - Non-ace so has less stats.

  notes: >
      _Her offensive buffing is mediocre when considering the necessary ramp-up and lack of rush buff, but her damage output and hitcount racking is 
      solid, and she provides two welcome safety nets between her hitcount timer extension and potent party regen._

      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good damage.
      - Decent rush gain.
      - Fast hitcount generation, making her a good friend to units dependent on it.
      - Rare single target DMG buff.
      - Self crit buff on Rush for Crystal Guardian
      
      **Cons**
      - Long rush animation guaranteed to annoy your party.
      - Bow animations make kiting bosses harder than it needs to be, and she is often forced into that due to high aggro gen.
      - Underwhelming buffs, especially compared to shooters of similar strength.
