      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong ATK based buff and elemental post rush buff.
      
      - Huge AP recovery on normal buff.
      
      - Cheaper dodging and can air dodge.
      
      - Innate Light & Dark imbue.
      
      - Has a melee and ranged skill set.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - ATK buff condition is inconsistent.
      
      - Self imbue can be a downside against certain bosses if you don't own certain weapons.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      - As a note YoRHa Pod: One VS YoRHa Arms: Two is a personal preference. Whether you want a better ranged combo or using Arms Two
      as a vertical dodge.
      
      *Normal > YoRHa Arms: One > YoRHa Pod: Two > YoRHa Arms: One > Spam it till out of AP. (General combo.)*
      
      *Normal > YoRHa Pod: Two > YoRHa Arms: One (Miss on purpose) > YoRHa Pod: Two > Spam it till out of AP. (Ranged combo.)*
      
      *Normal > YoRHa Pod: Two > YoRHa Pod: One > YorHa Pod: Two > Spam it till out of AP. (Ranged combo if running ranged set up.)*

      **Pros**
      
      - Strong ATK based buff for the party.
      
      - AP reduction and even more post rush allows skill spamming.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Doesn't bring any utility beyond his ATK buff.
      
      - Low ATK stat gives him lower damage compared to competing units.

      **Pros**
      
      - Gives a strong passive crit buff and an unmatched post rush buff to crit rate.
      
      - 5 star non-ace so costs less to limit break and augment.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats.
      
      - Poor damage and little utility beyond crit buffing.

      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Unconditional good ATK buff.
      
      - Rush combo damage buff.
      
      - Defence debuff on rush for enemies.
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - ATK buff has been exceeded by many attackers making it redundant in a lot of comps.
      
      - Silence has a low chance to apply making it a poor talent that doesn't do much.
      
      - Doesn't do enough that other attackers don't already do better.

      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so costs less to limit break and augment.
      
      - Unique party wide buffs
      
      - Built in AP reduction
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats.
      
      - Buffs aren't really that relevant outside of niche comps and content
      
      - ATK buff is overshadowed by many other attackers
            
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Palm of Destruction > Crescent Locus > Palm of Destruction > Spam till out of AP (Damage rotation)*

      - Does a good amount of damage
      
      - Some weak utility to the party
      
      - Works well with hit counter characters if no ATK buffer
      
            
      **Cons**
            
      - Party Utility is weak without the right characters
      
      - If no ATK buffer it requires a high hit count to get the most out of her

  notes: >
      _Fidel, the starter character and sometimes face of the app icon. He has the highest unconditional party wide buff in the game 
      at 50% now due to awakening. His AP reduction talent and really potent AP reduection post rush, lets him really output a lot of 
      damage by chaining attacks. Due to this, he can spam his improved Air raid (720%!!) for tons of damage and rush gain. He will 
      be a solid pick even if there are better units out._
      
      
      _Despite awakening increasing his own damage output, it doesn't change his role as being only an ATK buffer. The 50% ATK is nice
      but with Valentine Rena and buff to 2B, he can be outshined due to those units having better party utility despite said units
      having conditionals._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong ATK based buff for the party.
      
      - AP reduction and even more post rush allows skill spamming.
      
      - Can be used also be played at range with Air Slash > Empyrean Slash spam
      
      - Air Raid has high rush gain. This makes <20 second rushes very possible after an initial rush
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Doesn't bring any utility beyond his ATK buff.
      
      - All his awakening talents only effect himself
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Double Slash / Air Slash > Empyrean Slash > Air Raid > Spam it till out of AP. (General Combo)

  notes: >
      _Innately does Light/Fire damage.  Buffs both ATK and attribute damage, but his ATK buff is low and his attribute buffing isn't unique.
      Awakening similarly didn't boost his skills by as much as it needed to; he takes a lot of investment for a subpar ATK buffer._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Decent ATK buff
      
      - Double self imbue
      
      - Passive elemental damage buff
      
      - Awooo
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Has no ranged attack
      
      - Needs certain weapons against bosses with elemental resist
      
      - His anti-flinch is pretty useless at this point

      _Favors Attackers and Defenders with his buffing, which with the popularity and strength of Shooters tends to mean he wants a tailored party.
      Notably he was the first character to provide AP+150% via normals, but sources of AP gain are plentiful at this point.  Doesn't do much else to
      stand out, and really wishes he had a better rush buff._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Powerful ATK buff for attackers and defenders.
      
      - Damage reduction for healers.
      
      - Ap recovery on Normals.
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Poor synergy with sharpshooters and invokers.
      
      - Post-rush buff made redundant by commonly seen characters like Maria and 9S.
            
      
      **Rotation**

      _I hope you like stun.  Additional hits on skills for the party in addition to his party stun rate increase allow him to facilitate frequent stun rates as
      well as frequent rushes, without reliance on any other party talents.  His rush for the first time in the game's life does legitimately good damage,
      and he now offers an ATK/INT damage taken debuff on stunned bosses that by far and away dwarfs every other available option - and since
      stun persists through rushes, it applies there now too.  Separately from awakening and exclusive to him, his Dragon Roar has both been sped
      up and now has a much larger hitbox, seemingly making it a reliable if not amazing option universally now._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Slight invoking time buff
      
      - Ridiculous buff to partywide stun rate
      
      - Strong greedy post-rush buff
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Brings little utility beyond his stun buff
      
      - Needs some slight build around to take advantage of his buff

      _Her buffs are spread a bit thin, and her ATK Damage Taken debuff is contingent on winning dice rolls with Seal.  Though she boasts some high
      mults, the corresponding skills are fairly slow.  Still, she has no role restrictions, and every once in awhile Seal might keep a boss from using 
      something annoying._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Unconditional good ATK buff
      
      - Rush combo damage buff
      
      - Defence debuff on rush for enemies.
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - ATK buff has been exceeded by many attackers making it redundant in a lot of comps
      
      - Silence has a low chance to apply making it a poor talent that doesn't do much
      
      - Doesn't do enough other attackers don't already do better

      _Places emphasis on hitcount and rush damage.  Excels at fighting large bosses, where Northern Cross can get more hits than advertised, but
      depending on the fight, or the party's goals, or personal playstyle, it may be preferable to focus on racking hitcount with Sword Dance instead.
      All five of his skills are useful; you'll want at least one of Northern Cross or Sword Dance, the rest is fair game._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong Elemental and Rush damage buff.
      
      - Deals good damage.
      
      - Has both a ranged and melee combo.
      
      - Fun playstyle.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Elemental damage buff gets overwritten by a lot of characters post rush. Some of which are extremely popular.
      
      - Rush damage buff requires high hit count to get the best from it.

      hitcount racking fulfills hitcount talents with ease, and lets him do what he does best: fill his rush gauge and flex his rush.  If you need big rush

  notes: >
      _Sort of like the Attacker counterpart to Ronyx, in that she offers conversion services for the opposite role alongside various other QoL perks
      for everyone.  In effect she ends up playing a bit more like VCaleen.  Her ATK buff being what it is doesn't particularly make her suitable as a
      primary buffer for ATK-based parties, but her weapon type, skillset, and other perks make her welcome to any caster comp, and her having a
      little bit of everything makes her a safe pick for automatching._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so costs less to limit break and augment.
      
      - Unique party wide buffs
      
      - Built in AP reduction
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats.
      
      - Buffs aren't really that relevant outside of niche comps and content
      
      - ATK buff is overshadowed by many other attackers
            
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Palm of Destruction > Crescent Locus > Palm of Destruction > Spam till out of AP (Damage rotation)*
      
      *Normal > Crescent Locus > Palm of Destruction > Current Knuckle^n (Small enemies)*
