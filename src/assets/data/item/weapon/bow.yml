    A wind bow intended for Reimi. If you don't have the windburst bow this is very much worth having as an elemental bow. Extra plus
    plus points on a good Reimi player.

    An odd bow, seems like it's meant for Ronyx but it doesn't increase INT at all. However if you have no other bows it's not bad, strong
    final factor and it has a good attack boost on it to make up for the lack of stats.

    It's okay as an offensive stat stick, it's the only bow in both the shop and transmute pool so it's very easy to get one to mlb,
    not that you actually want to get it to MLB.

    An okay bow. It's better with SMiki but it's not fantastic and there are better bows. You can use it for transmute or fodder but
    it's not as if you can transmute it into a better bow.

    A good weapon by the sheer fact it's an element bow. The third factor is inconsistent, but characters with hit count talents will
    appreciate the second factor. One of the best bows you can currently get.

    Ronyx gets a real bow, this is his BiS weapon so if you have it just stick it on your Ronyx and let him rot along with it.

    A wind bow that retires the one you got from Jie. The recovery is a nice factor that to have, and it actually has a pretty good
    mlb factor to reward the player for getting to that point.

    A light imbue bow that offers some solid factors, it boosts light damage dealt and the AP cost reduction is sizeable enough that
    it can be pretty relevant to allow certain damage rotations. A great pick-up if you get it.

    Not a great bow, stats are decent by GL standards but it's effects are weak, even for Fina who it's intended for. Probably better
    off at fodder unless you've nothing better.

    It's a bow for freebie Claude. Very good for him, can be good on Ronyx too. Not great for anyone else but maybe at a stretch Fina
    for the tiny INT scaling boost but that's a realy stretch.
