    It's okay. You can throw this on a DPS if you want, but HIT has very little impact on crit chance unless your HIT reaches 1100+. Use as DEF stat stick if you're lazy (and don't want to unequip units when switching characters). If you want to try to increase your offense just a little bit, worth running on someone who can't use another accessory well. Shooters mainly.

    Beats Snow God. INT damage is at least a quantifiable stat with visible benefits, and has the bonus of not being common on too many units. However, when paired with SMyu/Reimi, this has no use aside from stat stick. MLB'able as well. Thankfully, it stacks with regular damage taken.

    A slight talent upgrade to the Resolve accessory, which unfortunately we can't MLB. HP isn't bad and for what it's worth it stacks with other talents, given that HP is a pre-battle stat buff. 30% chance also visually looks better than 20%. Overall quite usable, consider on Maria/SMyuria when not running something offensive.
