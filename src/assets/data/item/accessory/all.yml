If you want to try to increase your offense just a little bit, worth running on someone who can't use another accessory well. Shooters mainly.

    Excellent accesory, its own downside being that it's not MLB-able at the moment, meaning less DEF if choosing to run it. Crit rate pre-rush is an excellent invisible damage booster (the first acc to do so) and stun rate is great when lacking either in talents.

    Beats Snow God. INT damage is at least a quantifiable stat with visible benefits, and has the bonus of not being common on too many units. However, when paired with SMyu/Reimi, this has no use aside from stat stick. MLB'able as well. Thankfully, it stacks with regular damage taken.

    A slight talent upgrade to the Resolve accessory, which unfortunately we can't MLB. HP isn't bad and for what it's worth it stacks with other talents, given that HP is a pre-battle stat buff. 30% chance also visually looks better than 20%. Overall quite usable, consider on Maria/SMyuria when not running something offensive.
